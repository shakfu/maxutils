# The Archive

This folder contains older 'working' versions of some of the scripts in this project.

These may be updated, so are kept for posterity.

## standalone.py (single-class version)

This was the initial script which worked and successfully led to notarizing my first standalone.

I still think there are merits to a monolithic single class approach compared to the current multi-class implementation, so I will probably revisit this at some point.

## shrink.py (lipo -remove edition)

This was the first version of the `shrink.py` script which was written before I was informed about the `ditto --arch <src> <dst>` by @SOURCE-AUDIO in the cycling74 forums.

It's definitely inferior to the current version, not sure why it is being retained.
