## standalone.py

- `standalone.py` includes a direct python translation of a ruby script posted in the [cycling74 forums](https://cycling74.com/forums/mac-standalone-codesigning-2021-update) by Dan Nigirin. Much Thanks!

- Thanks to Mathias Rebbe, who wrote just about the [best guide ever](https://lessons.livecode.com/m/4071/l/1122100-codesigning-and-notarizing-your-lc-standalone-for-distribution-outside-the-mac-appstore) to codesigning and notarization. Although this was written for the [Livecode](livecode.com) programming environment, it is so thorough, clear and well-written that it is the best guide I've found for the subject per se.

## shrink.py

`shrink.py`: Thanks to SOURCE AUDIO on the cycling74 dev forums for the [reference to ditto](https://cycling74.com/forums/shrink-py-a-python-script-to-shrink-multi-arch-standalones/replies/1#reply-61ffa7a92afe8b4f2844555b) hich is more effective (and space saving) than my earlier efforts using `lipo --remove`
